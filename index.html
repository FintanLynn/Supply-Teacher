<h2>About Me</h2>
<img src="/w3images/avatar3.png" class="w3-margin w3-circle" alt="Person" style="width:30%">
<div class="w3-left-align w3-padding-large">
<p>Following a successful year as a full-time class teacher at Freshford Primary School, I am currently supply-teaching in Bath and Wiltshire where I am looking to inspire more children to aim high and to embrace every learning opportunity.</p>
<p>I believe that children respond best when they know that adults care. This belief has permeated into all my undertakings and has resulted in the creation of many positive professional relationships with children. I respect children's opinions, value their input and encourage them to take ownership of their learning. Both as a teacher and a play-worker I have been inspired by teaching children. Through high expectations I have enabled children to rise to challenges, empowered them to take on  responsibilities and encouraged them to enjoy learning. Witnessing the holistic development of children drives me. Educationally I believe that a safe, enjoyable and interactive learning environment is the best for ensuring progress for every child. Furthermore, I believe that from an empowering foundation children flourish naturally.</p>
